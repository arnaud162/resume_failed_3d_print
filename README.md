If your 3D print was interupted measure the height of the unfinished part.
Use then the pytohn script or the .exe (inside dist folder) to generate a gcode starting from the height of the unfinished part.
Let's say for instance part printing was interupted at 20mm, a new gcode starting at altitude z=20mm will be generated. 

This program was only tested on an easythreed x1, so to be used with caution.
